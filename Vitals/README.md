#Vitals

Vitals is a small shell script which gets that gets some basic stats of your Raspberry Pi running the Rasbian distribution. 


#####The majority of the command runs using the vcgencmd command. This will recieve some system stats when ran. Here are a list of the commands;
```$ vcgencmd commands```

```vcos, ap_output_control, ap_output_post_processing, vchi_test_init, vchi_test_exit, pm_set_policy, pm_get_status, pm_show_stats, pm_start_logging, pm_stop_logging, version, commands, set_vll_dir, led_control, set_backlight, set_logging, get_lcd_info, set_bus_arbiter_mode, cache_flush, otp_dump, codec_enabled, get_camera, get_mem, measure_clock, measure_volts, measure_temp, get_config, hdmi_ntsc_freqs, hdmi_status_show, render_bar, disk_notify, inuse_notify, sus_suspend, sus_status, sus_is_enabled, sus_stop_test_thread, egl_platform_switch, mem_validate, mem_oom, mem_reloc_stats, file, vctest_memmap, vctest_start, vctest_stop, vctest_set, vctest_get```

This is a cool little shell script that i wrote to keep an eye on system stats at any time. I plan on eventually adding some more, and cleaning it up a bit. 

Check back for more updates and other things.

Thanks for checking it out!
